  abstract = {In actively eroding landscapes, fluvial abrasion modifies the characteristics of the sediment carried by rivers and consequently has a direct impact on the ability of mountain rivers to erode their bedrock and on the characteristics and volume of the sediment exported from upland catchments. In this experimental study, we use a novel flume replicating hydrodynamic conditions prevailing in mountain rivers to investigate the role played by different controlling variables on pebble abrasion during fluvial transport. Lithology controls abrasion rates and processes, with differences in abrasion rates exceeding two orders of magnitude. Attrition as well as breaking and splitting are efficient processes in reducing particle size. Mass loss by attrition increases with particle velocity but is weakly dependent on particle size. Fragment production is enhanced by the use of large particles, high impact velocities and the presence of joints. Based on our experimental results, we extrapolate a preliminary generic relationship between pebble attrition rate and transport stage ({$\tau$}*/{$\tau$}*c), where {$\tau$}* = fluvial Shields stress and {$\tau$}*c = critical Shields stress for incipient pebble motion. This relationship predicts that attrition rates are independent of transport stage for ({$\tau$}*/{$\tau$}*c) {$\leq$} 3 and increase linearly with transport stage beyond this value. We evaluate the extent to which abrasion rates control downstream fining in several different natural settings. A simplified model predicts that the most resistant lithologies control bed load flux and fining ratio and that the concavity of transport-limited river profiles should rarely exceed 0.25 in the absence of deposition and sorting.},

  abstract = {As rocks are transported, they primarily undergo two breakdown mechanisms: chipping and fragmentation. Chipping occurs at relatively low collision energies typical of bed-load transport, and involves shallow cracking; this process rounds river pebbles in a universal manner. Fragmentation involves catastrophic breakup by fracture growth in the bulk \textemdash{} a response that occurs at high collision energies such as rock falls \textemdash{} and produces angular shards. Despite its geophysical significance, the 5 transition from chipping to fragmentation is not well studied. Indeed, most models implicitly assume that impact erosion of pebbles and bedrock is governed by fragmentation rather than chipping. Here we experimentally delineate the boundary between chipping and fragmentation by examining the mass and shape evolution of concrete particles in a rotating drum. Attrition rate should be a function of both impact energy and material strength; here we keep the former constant, while systematically varying the latter. For sufficiently strong particles, chipping occurred and was characterized by the following: 10 daughter products were significantly smaller than the parent; attrition rate was independent of material strength; and particles experienced monotonic rounding toward a spherical shape. As strength decreased, fragmentation became more significant: mass of daughter products became larger and more varied; attrition rate was inversely proportional to material strength; and shape evolution fluctuated and became non monotonic. Our results validate a previously proposed probabilistic model for impact attrition, and indicate that bedrock erosion models predicated on fragmentation failure need to be revisited. We suggest 15 that the shape of natural pebbles may be utilized to deduce the breakdown mechanism, and infer past transport environments.},

  abstract = {Morphodynamic models of coastal evolution require relatively simple parameterizations of sediment transport for application over larger scales. Here we present a transport parameterization for bimodal distributions of coarse quartz grains using simulations from a discrete particle model for sheet flow and near sheet flow conditions. The discrete particle model simulates the simplest one-dimensional fluid using a turbulent eddy viscosity determined from a mixing length coupled to particle motions. The motions of individual sand grains are simulated using spherical elements. Newton's second law in translational and rotational forms is solved for every particle in the domain as determined by both grain-grain and grain-fluid interactions. The forcing from idealized monochromatic waves is accomplished by specifying a spatially constant, time varying horizontal pressure gradient acting on the simulation domain. Consequently, the time series of the free-stream fluid acceleration and velocity are also fixed. Simulations cover a range of wave forcing, diameter ratios for the large and small grains in the bimodal size distribution, and mass ratios of large to small grains in the simulation domain, for a total of 243 unique simulation conditions. The simulation results are successfully parameterized with a simple power law that allows for the prediction of the transport rates of each size fraction in the bimodal distribution. The simple power law determined from simulations provides favorable predictions of transport rates for each size fraction when applied to available laboratory data for sheet flow with bimodal size distributions. It is important to note that rapid vertical kinematic sorting of grains by size is explicitly simulated with the model and thus implicitly captured by the power law. Discussion focuses on practical application of the power law.},

  abstract = {The concept of `megafloods' and `superfloods' was introduced at the end of the last century to define exceptionally large-discharge floods, primarily those associated with the failure of Quaternary ice-dams. These floods exceeded, by one or two magnitudes, historically recorded floods, megafloods having peak discharges equalling, or exceeding, 1~M~m3~s-1. Herein, the sediment associations of exceptional floods are found to be distinctive, being dominated by comminuted (smashed) grain-size distributions, which contrast to the sediment deposits of more moderate floods. A consideration of the energetics of moderate floods, superfloods and megafloods with respect to the entrainment, dis-entrainment, suspension and comminution of coarse gravel allows thresholds of energy expenditure to be proposed that reflect general transformations in flood behaviour that relate to distinctive flood deposits. A threshold of energy expenditure - 20~kJ~s-1~m-2 - is proposed to separate moderate floods from superfloods; the latter by this definition can be \textasciitilde{} 0.1~M~m3~s-1. This threshold separates floods competent to entrain cobbles and boulders (with limited comminution of the load) from superfloods that comminute the suspended cobbles and boulders to produce fine granules in suspension. The granules are subsequently deposited to form distinct depositional units that are characteristic of superfloods and megafloods. The energetic threshold is consistent with the lower range of power expenditures associated with the original definition of a megaflood in terms of peak fluid flux. Significance Exceptional floods occurred in prehistoric times; the largest are referred to as `megafloods' or `superfloods'. To distinguish such exceptional floods from other large floods, megafloods were defined as having a peak discharge exceeding 1~M~m3~s-1. However, many reports of `megafloods' are flows with a peak discharge smaller than 1~M~m3~s-1. Recent research has shown that megafloods and superfloods deposit distinctive layers of smashed gravel, which is not the case for smaller floods. The gravel is smashed by exceptionally high-energy expenditures. Consideration of the energetics of floods to transport gravel allows a robust quantitative definition of `superflood' based on the energy needed to smash a range of gravel sizes.},

However, the current approaches to monitoring and modeling fluvial transport of microplastic pollution have primarily relied on sampling the surface of flow and assumptions about microplastic concentration depth profiles to estimate the depth-averaged concentration. The Rouse profile was adapted to show that fluvial transport of microplastic pollution includes all traditional domains of transport (bed load, settling suspended load, and wash load), as well as additional domains specific to low-density materials with rising velocities in water (rising suspended load and surface load). The modified Rouse profile was applied to describe the positively buoyant particle concentration depth profiles and compared to field observations to showcase the utility of this approach. A procedure was developed for assessing the uncertainty and bias from using a surface sample to estimate the depth-averaged concentration while assuming either surface load or wash load concentration depth profiles. Both assumptions may introduce a large amount of uncertainty due to the range of suspended microplastic concentration depth profiles. Monitoring microplastic pollution and estimating the depth-averaged concentration of microplastics in fluvial systems would further benefit from broader adoption of depth-integrated sampling, characterization of particle concentration depth profiles, and estimation of uncertainties in depth-averaged concentration based on the sampling approach.},

  abstract = {River bed sediments typically fine downstream, where fining of median grain sizes are often described as exponential, except where fine gravel abruptly transitions to sand. Across the gravel-sand transition, median grain sizes can reduce by more than 10~mm ({$>$}90\%) over a distance of only a few channel widths. There are several viable theories for why the gravel-sand transition occurs, but they remain a matter of ongoing discussion in the literature. Here, we present a review of known morphological characteristics associated with gravel-sand transitions and the existing theories for their development (e.g., abrasion, size selective transport, washload deposition). This is combined with a global database of published gravel-sand transitions across a range of climatic, tectonic and geographic settings. We identify an absence of universal morphological characteristics associated with the transition. However, the position of the transition is relatively predictable, occurring either a small distance downstream of mountain ranges or at a characteristic backwater distance upstream of a base-level control. This supports previous findings where the position of the transition is sensitive to long-term changes in gravel runout distance (e.g., through changes in gravel supply, basin subsidence rate) and/or changes in base level (e.g., sea level rise). Both backwater effects and exhaustion of gravel supply generate a distinct and abrupt change in water surface slope between the gravel and sand reaches, suggesting this is a control on the location at which they develop. The abrupt nature of the gravel-sand transition is then considered in terms of the two theories that seem most able to explain the phenomenon at the granular scale. We also focus on the apparent absence of river beds with median bed grain diameters of \textasciitilde 1\textendash 10~mm, or within the `grain size gap', to better understand how this relates to the development and nature of gravel-sand transitions. The absence of median bed grain sizes within this range may be a reflection of grain size statistics, where these grain sizes are actually present but never dominate bed material. Alternatively, these grain sizes may be absent from hillslope sediment sources. Finally, we consider how particle dynamics may prevent formation of a stable gravel bed with gap material. Even if these grain sizes are produced on hillslopes, particles may raft downstream over the sand bed and disperse. Research into how grain size gap material is generated, transported and deposited in river systems should be a future priority.},

We assess the range of validity of models through simulations of the experimental tests by Vanoni (1946), Einstein and Chien (1955), Taggart et al. (1972), Coleman (1986), and Wang and Qian (1992). The K - {$\varepsilon$} model is used to represent the turbulence in the carrier phase, and the kinetic theory of gases is employed for the closure of stresses due to inter-particle collisions. We test various closures for the eddy viscosity of the disperse phase; we show the effects of increasing sediment concentration on the interaction forces between the two phases and on the stresses developed due to inter-particle collisions. We determine the values of the Schmidt number required to approximate the experimental profiles of the volumetric concentration of sediment, suggesting that while the Schmidt number is smaller than one for dilute mixtures, it is larger than one for nondilute flows. Results indicate that nondilute models of increasing complexity are indeed necessary for flows having high solid volume fractions. Our results also suggest a more tested range of values for the threshold of sediment concentration of nondilute flows; this threshold can be located between 2 and 5\%. It is observed that the virtual mass force becomes important in the simulation of nondilute flows. The eddy viscosity of the carrier phase is found to decrease with the increasing volumetric concentration in the flow.},

Compared with fluxes of sand-sized grains, mud fluxes are difficult to predict. Yet, understanding the fate of muddy river sediment is fundamental to the global carbon cycle, coastal landscape resilience to sea-level rise, river restoration and river\textendash floodplain morphodynamics on Earth and Mars. Mechanistic theories exist for suspended sand transport, but mud in rivers is often thought to constitute washload\textemdash sediment with settling velocities so slow that it does not interact with the bed, such that it depends only on upstream supply and is impossible to predict from local hydraulics. To test this hypothesis, we compiled sediment concentration profiles from the literature from eight rivers and used an inversion technique to determine settling rates of suspended mud. We found that mud in rivers is largely flocculated in aggregates that have near-constant settling velocities, independent of grain size, of approximately 0.34\,mm\,s-1, which is 100-fold faster than rates for individual particles. Our findings indicate that flocculated mud is part of suspended bed-material load, not washload, and thus can be physically described by bed-material entrainment theory.},

Herein, a comprehensive sediment load database for fine-grained channels, ranging from small experimental flumes to megarivers, is used to find a predictive algorithm. Two distinct transport regimes emerge, separated by a discontinuous transition for median bed grain size within the very fine sand range (81 to 154 {$\mu$}m), whereby sediment flux decreases by up to 100-fold for coarser sand-bedded rivers compared to river with silt and very fine sand beds. Evidence suggests that the discontinuous change in sediment load originates from a transition of transport mode between mixed suspended bed load transport and suspension-dominated transport. Events that alter bed sediment size near the transition may significantly affect fluviocoastal morphology by drastically changing sediment flux, as shown by data from the Yellow River, China, which, over time, transitioned back and forth 3 times between states of high and low transport efficiency in response to anthropic activities.},

The evidence of well-developed fluvial meanders on Mars indicates that the process can occur without the help of stabilizing plant cover. By virtue of cohesive forces, mud can provide strength, but the mechanism of accretion along inner banks in active currents in meanders is poorly understood. The Quinn River in Nevada (slope = 0.00015, bankfull width = 19.8m), an actively meandering river with sparse vegetation on the floodplain, provides an opportunity to explore these issues in depth. The river reworks silt and clay deposits of paleo-Lake Lahontan, which generates a muddy load that combines with fine sand from upstream sources. Stratigraphic sections across the inner bank show that lateral accretion deposits consist of alternating sand-rich and mud-dominated interbeds. Both lidar and drone photos clearly display higher elevated floodplain at the upstream side of the bend and lower topography at downstream inner bank, which provide clues to the deposition and erosion pattern on the floodplain. Flow field measurements through a bend and suspended sediment measurements at a modest discharge are used to constrain the application of Delft3D to predict patterns of erosion and deposition. By default Delft3D treats mud and sand transport calculations separately, yet we find all mud deposits are sandy, and all sand deposits are muddy. By modifying settling velocities to include sand in the cohesive mud transport, and increasing settling velocities of clay to account for flocculation, Delft3D predicts deposition that sensibly varies with flow stage. The local condition of cohesive sediment erosion or deposition is accurately predicted from the dimensionless ratio R, which depends on boundary shear stress, size-dependent sediment concentration and settling velocity, and entrainment parameters. In shallow overbank simulations, the sand, silt and clay deposit together to build an elevated inner bank deposit, as suggested in the lidar map. However, in an extreme flood condition, flow cuts channels across this deposit. Further work is underway to predict meander growth and cutoff in this sandy mud depositing system.},

The contribution of abrasion is uncertain, in part because (1) diameter is insufficient to characterize pebble mass loss due to abrasion and (2) abrasion rates measured in laboratory experiments cannot be easily extrapolated to the field. A recent geometric theory describes abrasion as a curvature-dependent process that produces a two-phase evolution: in Phase I, initially blocky pebbles round to smooth, convex shapes with little reduction in axis dimensions; then, in Phase II, smooth, convex pebbles slowly reduce their axis dimensions. Here we provide strong evidence that two-phase abrasion occurs in a natural setting, by examining downstream evolution of shape and size of thousands of pebbles over 10 km in a tropical montane stream. The geometric theory is verified in this river system using a variety of manual and image-based shape parameters, providing a generalizable method for quantifying the significance of abrasion. Phase I occurs over 1 km, in upstream bedrock reaches where abrasion is dominant and sediment storage is limited. In downstream alluvial reaches, where Phase II occurs, we observe the expected exponential decline in pebble diameter. Using a discretized abrasion model (the so-called ``box equations'') with deposition, we deduce that abrasion removes more than one third of the mass of a pebble but that size-selective sorting dominates downstream changes in pebble diameter. Overall, abrasion is the dominant process in the downstream diminution of pebble mass (but not diameter) in the studied river, with important implications for pebble mobility and the production of fine sediments.},

  abstract = {The present paper reports results obtained with image velocimetry to provide new insights into the two-phase nature of sediment-laden flows. The resulting two-phase flow perspective is compared with the traditional mixed-flow (or combined phase) perspective that treats sediment-laden flows essentially as flow of a single fluid. The insights are from flume experiments entailing the use of fully suspended natural sand and neutrally buoyant particles conveyed in a turbulent open channel flow of water. They confirm that suspended particles (irrespective of particle density) may affect a turbulent flow throughout its depth. Suspended particles modify flow turbulence, the main effects quantified being decreases in the bulk water velocity and in the von K\'arman constant, while the flow's friction velocity remains approximately constant. Comparison of the results obtained with the two particle densities reveals differences in particle influences on water flow. In the flows conveying sand the characteristics of water and particle movement are strongly coupled, yet distinct; that is, there is a lag in the mean velocity between local water and particle movement, and intensities of water turbulence differ from intensities of particle motion turbulence. These results confirm and extend prior two-phase flow perspectives on suspended-particle transport and indicate the inaccuracies in some assumptions associated with the mixed fluid formulation of suspended-particle transport.},

  abstract = {The transport and deposition of mud in rivers are key processes in fluvial geomorphology and biogeochemical cycles. Recent work indicates that flocculation might regulate fluvial mud transport by increasing mud settling velocities, but we lack a calibrated mechanistic model for flocculation in freshwater rivers. Here, we developed and calibrated a semi-empirical model for floc diameter and settling velocity in rivers. We compiled a global data set of river suspended sediment concentration-depth profiles and inverted them for in situ settling velocity using the Rouse-Vanoni equation. On average, clay and silt (diameters {$<$}39 {$\mu$}m) are flocculated with settling velocity of 1.8 mm s-1 and floc diameter of 130 {$\mu$}m. Among model variables, Kolmogorov microscale has the strongest positive correlation with floc diameter, supporting the idea that turbulent shear limits floc size. Sediment Al/Si (a mineralogy proxy) has the strongest negative correlation with floc diameter and settling velocity, indicating the importance of clay abundance and composition for flocculation. Floc settling velocity increases with greater mud and organic matter concentrations, consistent with flocculation driven by particle collisions and binding by organic matter which is often concentrated in mud. Relative charge density (a salinity proxy) correlates with smaller floc settling velocities, a finding that might reflect the primary particle size distribution and physical hosting of organic matter. The calibrated model explains river floc settling velocity data within a factor of about two. Results highlight that flocculation can impact the fate of mud and particulate organic carbon, holding implications for global biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {River currents, wind, and waves drive bed-load transport, in which sediment particles collide with each other and Earth's surface. A generic consequence is impact attrition and rounding of particles as a result of chipping, often referred to in geological literature as abrasion. Recent studies have shown that the rounding of river pebbles can be modeled as diffusion of surface curvature, indicating that geometric aspects of impact attrition are insensitive to details of collisions and material properties. We present data from fluvial, aeolian, and coastal environments and laboratory experiments that suggest a common relation between circularity and mass attrition for particles transported as bed load. Theory and simulations demonstrate that universal characteristics of shape evolution arise because of three constraints: (i) Initial particles are mildly elongated fragments, (ii) particles collide with similarly-sized particles or the bed, and (iii) collision energy is small enough that chipping dominates over fragmentation but large enough that sliding friction is negligible. We show that bed-load transport selects these constraints, providing the foundation to estimate a particle's attrition rate from its shape alone in most sedimentary environments. These findings may be used to determine the contribution of attrition to downstream fining in rivers and deserts and to infer transport conditions using only images of sediment grains. Sediments moved by wind, rivers, and waves round in the same way due to geometry. Sediments moved by wind, rivers, and waves round in the same way due to geometry.},

  abstract = {Rivers transfer terrestrial organic carbon (OC) from mountains to ocean basins, playing a key role in the global carbon cycle. During fluvial transit, OC may be oxidized and emitted to the atmosphere as CO2 or preserved and transported to downstream depositional sinks. The balance between oxidation and preservation determines the amount of particulate OC (POC) that can be buried long term, but the factors regulating this balance are poorly constrained. Here, we quantify the effects of fluvial transit on POC fluxes along an \textasciitilde 1,300\,km lowland channel with no tributaries. We show that sediment transit time and mineral protection regulate the magnitude and rate of POC oxidation, respectively. Using a simple turnover model, we estimate that annual POC oxidation is a small percentage of the POC delivered to the river. Modelling shows that lateral erosion into POC-rich floodplains can increase POC fluxes to downstream basins, thereby offsetting POC oxidation. Consequently, rivers with high channel mobility can enhance CO2 drawdown while management practices that stabilize river channels may reduce the potential for CO2 drawdown.},

  abstract = {Understanding how mud moves and deposits is essential for conceptualizing the dynamic nature of surface environments and their ancient counterparts. Experimental study has largely been pursued by civil engineers, using kaolinite as an active ingredient. Yet, applying their data to the physical comprehension of mudstone sedimentology is hampered by multiple flume configurations between labs, and data sets tailored to specific engineering needs. The need for a better grasp of underlying processes is acute, given recent flume studies that show that moving suspensions form large bedload floccules, migrating floccule ripples and bed accretion under currents capable of moving sand grains. To advance mudstone sedimentology, integrated study of suspended sediment concentration, salinity and bed shear stress on the deposition of floccules is crucial. Described here is a set of tightly controlled experiments that explored suspended sediment concentrations from 70 to 900 mg/l, freshwater, brackish and marine salinities, flow velocities in the 5 to 50 cm/s range (equivalent to 0.01 to 0.58 Pa bed shear), measured the size of in-flow and bedload floccules, and the critical velocity of sedimentation that marks the onset of sustained bedload accumulation. The critical velocity of sedimentation of kaolinite clays is in the 26 to 28 cm/s flow velocity range (0.22 to 0.25 Pa), appears insensitive to a wide range of suspended sediment concentrations and salinities, and coincides with the formation of sand-size bedload floccules. Further decrease of flow velocity/bed shear stress is accompanied by a steady increase in the size of bedload floccules. Large bedload floccules appear to form in the high-shear basal part of the flow, a phenomenon requiring further investigation. Better understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate mud deposition from moving suspensions is critical for more realistic assessments of the depositional conditions of mud and mudstones, as well as for refining predictive models for the flux of fine-grained sediments across the Earth's surface.},

Limited studies have been conducted about particle size and shape variation resulting from the abrasion of soil aggregate in overland flow. This experiment was based on aggregate abrasion in a 3.8m long flume with a fixed bed, and the particle size and shape variations were studied using dry sieving method and a Laser particle size and shape analyzer. Results indicated that the high abrasion rate of large particles (particles larger than 5mm) caused the mass percentage of particles in intermediate size ranges (2mm\textendash 1mm, 1mm\textendash 0.5mm and 0.5mm\textendash 0.25mm) increased with transport distance. The D50 values of Average Feret Diameter of smaller abraded aggregates (0.0385mm\textendash 0.25mm) increased first and then decreased, and their shape became more regular and rounder with the transport distance. There were significant negative correlations between RMI (relative mechanical breakdown index) of initial aggregates with MWD (Mean weight diameter) for particles larger than 0.25mm, and with Cirm (median value of Circularity Factor) for particles smaller than 0.25mm in all the five transport distances (p{$<$}0.05). These indicated that the initial aggregates had low susceptibility to mechanical breakdown, resulting in weak abrasion of particles larger than 0.25mm and regular shape of particles smaller than 0.25mm under certain transport distance in overland flow. A multiple regression equation was established, relating Cirm to RMI and transport distance (x) for estimating the particle shape of smaller abraded aggregates in overland flow. The information of the analysis of particle size and shape variation can be useful for the development of soil process-based erosion models.},

FPOM exhibits high carbon to nitrogen ratios, low respiratory rates, and is a relatively poor food source for invertebrates. However, little more is known of the qualitative nature of benthic FPOM, the nature of FPOM processing, or the relationship between benthic FPOM chemical composition and sources of organic matter to a stream system. In this study, qualitative characteristics of benthic FPOM were compared at three sites in the Oregon Cascade Mountains that received either conifer litter, alder leaves, or herbaceous and algal inputs. FPOM from these streams contained approximately 45\% lignin and 10-15\% cellulose (ash-free dry weight). Lignin content of particles {$>$}1 mm was almost 60\% whereas in those {$<$}0.01 mm it was 30-40\%. Based on qualitative differences between known organic matter inputs to these streams, lignin content in FPOM at the conifer site was predicted to be greater than that at the alder site, and to be least at the open site. No seasonal or site related patterns in FPOM lignin or cellulose content were found regardless of the type of canopy cover or aerial allochthonous inputs. FPOM respiration rates were predicted to follow the reverse pattern, highest at the open site and lowest at the conifer site. Respiratory rates at the open site were usually greater than those at the forested sites; but rates were not consistently lowest at the conifer site. Similarities in FPOM lignin and cellulose content and respiration rates among sites suggest that the qualitative characteristics of FPOM are not necessarily regulated by the qualitative characteristics of canopy inputs alone. Additional and as yet unquantified inputs of high lignin-containing allochthonous FPOM, such as soil or wood, may override differences of leaf litter inputs among these three sites.},

  abstract = {The assumption that distributions of mass versus size interval for fragmented materials fit the log normal distribution is empirically based and has historical roots in the late 19th century. Other often used distributions (e.g., Rosin-Rammler, Weibull) are also empirical and have the general form for mass per size interval: n(l) = kl{$\alpha$} exp (-l{$\beta$}), where n(l) represents the number of particles of diameter l, l is the normalized particle diameter, and k, {$\alpha$}, and {$\beta$} are constants. We describe and extend the sequential fragmentation distribution to include transport effects upon observed volcanic ash size distributions. The sequential fragmentation/transport (SFT) distribution is also of the above mathematical form, but it has a physical basis rather than empirical. The SFT model applies to a particle-mass distribution formed by a sequence of fragmentation (comminution) and transport (size sorting) events acting upon an initial mass m{${'}$}: n(x, m) = C {$\int\int$} n(x{${'}$}, m{${'}$})p({$\xi$})dx{${'}$} dm{${'}$}, where x{${'}$} denotes spatial location along a linear axis, C is a constant, and integration is performed over distance from an origin to the sample location and mass limits from 0 to m. We show that the probability function that models the production of particles of different size from an initial mass and sorts that distribution, p({$\xi$}), is related to mg, where g (noted as {$\gamma$} for fragmentation processes) is a free parameter that determines the location, breadth, and skewness of the distribution; g({$\gamma$}) must be greater than -1, and it increases from that value as the distribution matures with greater number of sequential steps in the fragmentation or transport process; {$\gamma$} is expected to be near -1 for ``sudden'' fragmentation mechanisms such as single-event explosions and transport mechanisms that are functionally dependent upon particle mass. This free parameter will be more positive for evolved fragmentation mechanisms such as ball milling and complex transport processes such as saltation. The SFT provides better fits to many types of volcanic ash samples than does the log normal curve. Modeling of the SFT shows its similarity to the log normal curve on size frequency histograms; it differs by its variable skewness controlled by {$\gamma$}. Skewed distributions are typical of many volcanic ash samples, and characterization of them by the SFT allows interpretation of eruptive and transport mechanisms.},

Fine sediment also affects the permeability of buried fluvial reservoirs. Despite this significance, there is currently a lack of methods for reconstructing how much fine sediment was transported by ancient rivers. Mud accumulations in sandy river deposits are often interpreted as indicators of variable flow conditions; however, these deposits may present an opportunity to constrain how much fine sediment was transported through ancient rivers. We report results from a series of experiments designed to evaluate how much clay and silt are preserved in sandy riverbed deposits under constant and variable discharge conditions. Our results demonstrate that (1) mud deposits, including drapes and lenses, form readily under constant, high-discharge conditions, (2) the amount of fine sediment recovered from bed-material deposits increases as fine-sediment supply increases, and (3) fine-sediment retention is higher during bed aggradation than during bypass conditions. These results indicate that the net retention of clay and silt in sandy riverbed deposits may be a simple but powerful proxy for comparing the overall amount of fine sediment supplied to ancient rivers.},

  abstract = {Mudstones contain substantial quantities of lamina-forming detrital quartz in the coarse silt size range, and some even contain lamina/lenses of sand. Whereas the origin of silty laminae is a partitioning phenomenon that affects bedload transport of flocculated muds, the implications of sandy layers are poorly understood. Due to potential bed erosion downstream of sand ripples, and loading of the substrate, one may wonder whether water-rich surface muds (soupy substrate) would be eroded prior to active sand accumulation or would collapse due to the added weight. For the interpretation of ancient successions this question is critical. If muds with intercalated sand layers/ripples imply (as commonly presumed) intermittent high energy conditions and erosion, one would have to also assume a substantial loss of stratigraphic continuity. Are there alternatives to this "conventional" interpretation? In a new set of experiments these issues were explored with sands of fine to coarse grain size. For example, we can show that medium to coarse sand can migrate across a surface of soupy flocculated mud (85 vol \% water content) without inflicting damage (erosion, fabric collapse) to the mud surface. Because the flow velocities at which mud beds accrete from migrating bedload ripples of flocculated clays overlap with erosional threshold and transport velocities for fine to coarse sand, we conducted experiments where sand was added to clay suspensions to explore their co-deposition. At constant flow velocity, sand grains continued to move over simultaneously accreting clay beds, forming thin layers of a few grains thickness. There are several implications from these experiments, one of them being that the presence of sand layers in mudstone successions does no longer automatically imply that a substantial portion of the sedimentary record may have been eroded by high energy events and lost. Instead the sand and mud may have accumulated under the same flow conditions with little or no associated erosion. In rivers with a mud-dominated load, the observed process may for example explain the seemingly counterintuitive interstratification of sand and mud in fluvial point bars during single flood events.},

The near-bed vertical sediment flux is a critical parameterization for suspended load models. In this paper, we show that the vertical sediment fluxes predicted by the two-phase model agree with the U-tube data for oscillatory flows. Both the measured data and model results indicated that the sediment upward flux (pick-up) increases with Shields parameter (or bottom bed stress) during the flow acceleration phase, but quickly reaches a saturated value with a ``plateau'' near the peak flow. This feature is also captured by the reference concentration formulation, but not the pick-up function formulation, developed empirically for steady flows. With further consideration of wave\textendash current interaction and wave-induced streaming inside the boundary layer, we conclude that to accurately parameterize the upward sediment flux, the feedback of the sediment phase to the carrier flows must be included. The feedback mechanism is introduced through sediment stresses and drag forces.},
